# LaravelAdvancedSearch

This adds an advanced search to your project.

Some functions:
- Search on relationships
- Make search groups, for example: Search for and (A or B) and C and (D or E)
- Search with where (contains, equals, greater than, etc.), search dates, and some more which are easily extendable

The files give the example on how to use.
